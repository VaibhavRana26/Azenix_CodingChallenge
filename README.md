# Azenix_CodingChallenge

Task - 

The task is to parse a log file containing HTTP requests and to report on its contents. For a given log file we
want to know:
● **The number of unique IP addresses
● The top 3 most visited URLs
● The top 3 most active IP addresses
**

**Example Data**
177.71.128.21 - - [10/Jul/2018:22:21:28 +0200] "GET /intranet-analytics/ HTTP/1.1" 200 3574 A log file with
test data is included with this assignment.

**Deliverables**
● For this task we ask that you use C#
● There are no restrictions on language features and you are free to use third-party libraries
● Please include tests that demonstrate your solution is working
● You can submit your solution as a zip file containing the source code or a public git repository

**How to run and view the output of the given task?**
1. Open the Task_Azenix.sln in the Visual Studio OR open the Task_Azenix folder and click on Porgram.cs file
2. Run the Program.cs file.
3. After running the project, command prompt will open and will ask for the file path.
4. I have added a static log file into the file folder which contains all the data. Hence, one can see the ouput by just hitting enter.
5. Else if one wants to provide a specific path of a log file, copy the file path of the folder in which the log file exists and add the file name with the .log extension, you  will observe the same output.
6. I have added a snapshot named as Output Screenshot.png, let's see an example of providing file path (C:\users\Documents\Azenix_CodingChallenge\programming-task-example-data.log) and hit enter after the exact file location.
